Hello, I'm NoxideKev, which is currently learning on how python works and using it to create things I wanted to do. It's quite a journey for me to understand how it works but yea.

This project is the result after I have learnt about lists, functions and dictionaries. Feel free to let me know if there's anything that I can improve with.

Thanks
